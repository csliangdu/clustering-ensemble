# clustering-ensemble

To demonstrate: Removal of some negative information from co-association matrix may lead to improvement of the clustering ensemble performance.

- RUN RemoveNegativeInfo.m to demonstrate

- RUN CluEnsemble.m to clustering

Ncut.zip is the normalized cut, Datasets.zip is the 16 datasets and ground truth labels. The project is tested in WIN7 (64bit) and MATLAB2012.
